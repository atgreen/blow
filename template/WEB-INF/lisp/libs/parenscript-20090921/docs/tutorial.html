    <center><h1>Parenscript Tutorial</h1></center>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      This is a short introductory tutorial to Parenscript written to
      give readers an idea of how Parenscript can be used in a Lisp
      web application.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting up the Parenscript environment</h2>

    <p>
      This tutorial assumes you have a Common Lisp implementation
      already
      installed. <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/getting.html">SBCL</a>
      is a good free software implementation if you don't have one.

      Besides Parenscript, the examples
      use <a href="http://www.weitz.de/hunchentoot/">Hunchentoot</a>
      as a web
      server, <a href="http://www.weitz.de/cl-who/">CL-WHO</a> for
      HTML generation,
      and <a href="http://www.weitz.de/cl-fad/">CL-FAD</a> for file
      utilities. These packages can be installed
      with <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/">clbuild</a>
      or <a href="http://www.cliki.net/ASDF-Install">ASDF-Install</a>. You
      will probably want to keep the Hunchentoot webpage open in
      another tab to refer to the documentation, since the Hunchentoot
      interface is not explained in this tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
      After installing the prerequisite libraries, let's load them.
    </p>
    
    <code><pre>
(dolist (x '(:hunchentoot :cl-who :parenscript :cl-fad))
  (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op x))
    </pre></code>

    <p>
      Next let's define a package to hold the example code
    </p>

    <code><pre>
(defpackage "PS-TUTORIAL"
  (:use "COMMON-LISP" "HUNCHENTOOT" "CL-WHO" "PARENSCRIPT" "CL-FAD"))

(in-package "PS-TUTORIAL")
    </pre></code>

    <p>
      One thing we have to do is make sure that CL-WHO and Parenscript use
      different string delimiters so that literal strings will work as
      intended in JavaScript code inlined in HTML element properties.
    </p>

    <code><pre>
(setf *js-string-delimiter* #\")
    </pre></code>

    <p>
      Now to start the server.
    </p>

    <code><pre>
(start (make-instance 'acceptor :port 8080))
    </pre></code>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p>
      The <code>ps</code> macro takes Parenscript code in the form of
      lists (Parenscript code and Common Lisp code share the same
      representation), translates as much as it can into constant
      JavaScript strings at macro-expansion time, and expands into a
      form that will evaluate to a string containing JavaScript code.
    </p>

    <code><pre>
(define-easy-handler (tutorial1 :uri "/tutorial1") ()
  (with-html-output-to-string (s)
    (:html
     (:head (:title "Parenscript tutorial: 1st example"))
     (:body (:h2 "Parenscript tutorial: 1st example")
            "Please click the link below." :br
            (:a :href "#" :onclick (ps (alert "Hello World"))
                "Hello World")))))
    </pre></code>

    <p>
      One way to include Parenscript code in web pages is to inline it in
      HTML <code>script</code> tags.
    </p>

    <code><pre>
(define-easy-handler (tutorial2 :uri "/tutorial2") ()
  (with-html-output-to-string (s)
    (:html
     (:head
      (:title "Parenscript tutorial: 2nd example")
      (:script :type "text/javascript"
               (str (ps
                      (defun greeting-callback ()
                        (alert "Hello World"))))))
     (:body
      (:h2 "Parenscript tutorial: 2nd example")
      (:a :href "#" :onclick (ps (greeting-callback))
          "Hello World")))))
    </pre></code>

    <p>
      Another way to integrate Parenscript into a web application is to
      serve the generated JavaScript as a separate HTTP
      resource. Requests to this resource can then be cached by the
      browser and proxies.
    </p>

    <code><pre>
(define-easy-handler (tutorial2-javascript :uri "/tutorial2.js") ()
  (setf (content-type*) "text/javascript")
  (ps
    (defun greeting-callback ()
      (alert "Hello World"))))
    </pre></code>

    <h2>Slideshow</h2>
    <p>
      Next we're going to examine a more complicated example - a web-based
      slideshow viewer.
    </p>

    <p>
      First we need a way to define slideshows. For this tutorial
      we'll assume that we have several different folders containing
      just images, and want to serve each of the folders as its own
      slideshow under its own URL. We'll use a hash table to keep
      track of what slideshows we are serving, which will also double
      as a cache of the image filenames, which will save us at least a
      system call and possibly disk access on every request. We'll use
      the
      <a href="http://www.weitz.de/hunchentoot/#create-folder-dispatcher-and-handler">folder
      dispatcher</a> function provided by Hunchentoot to serve the
      image files under /slideshow-images/{slideshow-name}/.
    </p>

    <code><pre>
(defvar *slideshows* (make-hash-table :test 'equalp))

(defun add-slideshow (slideshow-name image-folder)
  ;; we don't want to create duplicate dispatchers
  (unless (gethash slideshow-name *slideshows*)
    (push (create-folder-dispatcher-and-handler
           (format nil "/slideshow-images/~a/" slideshow-name)
           image-folder)
          *dispatch-table*))
  ;; but we do want to be able to refresh the cached list of image files
  (setf (gethash slideshow-name *slideshows*)
        (mapcar (lambda (pathname)
                  (url-encode (format nil "~a.~a"
                                      (pathname-name pathname)
                                      (pathname-type pathname))))
                (list-directory image-folder))))
    </pre></code>

    <p>
      Let's find some important pictures on our machine and get Hunchentoot to start
      serving them.
    </p>
    
    <code><pre>
(add-slideshow "lolcat" "/home/junk/lolcats/")
(add-slideshow "lolrus" "/home/other-junk/lolruses/")
    </pre></code>

    <p>
      Next we need to create the slideshow web page. Ideally we'd like to
      use JavaScript and DHTML to move through the slideshow without
      refreshing the whole page, but with a fallback to regular link
      navigation in case the client browser has JavaScript turned
      off. Either way we want users of our slideshow to be able to
      bookmark their place in the slideshow viewing sequence. The
      techniques we'll use to achieve this can be similarly applied to
      arbitrary asynchronous data loading via AJAX.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll need a way to generate URIs for slideshow images on both the
      server and client sides. We can eliminate code duplication by using
      the <code>defmacro/ps</code> macro, which is used to share macros
      between Common Lisp and Parenscript.
    </p>

    <code><pre>
(defmacro/ps slideshow-image-uri (slideshow-name image-file)
  `(concatenate 'string "/slideshow-images/" ,slideshow-name "/" ,image-file))
    </pre></code>

    <p>
Next is the function to serve up the slideshow page. The pages will
be served under /slideshows/{slideshow-name}, all of them handled
by a single function that will dispatch on {slideshow-name}.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regular navigation in the slideshow is done with the help of the
      "image" query parameter, which also allows bookmarking. For
      JavaScript-based image loading, we provide information about the
      slideshow in an inline script (generated using <code>ps*</code>,
      which is the function equivalent of the <code>ps</code> macro and
      is used for translating runtime-generated code) and give onclick
      handlers to the next/previous buttons.
    </p>

    <code><pre>
(defun slideshow-handler ()
  (cl-ppcre:register-groups-bind (slideshow-name) ("/slideshows/(.*)" (script-name*))
    (let* ((images (gethash slideshow-name *slideshows*))
           (current-image-index (or (position (get-parameter "image") images :test #'equalp)
                                    0))
           (previous-image-index (max 0 (1- current-image-index)))
           (next-image-index (min (1- (length images)) (1+ current-image-index))))
      (with-html-output-to-string (s)
        (:html
         (:head
          (:title "Parenscript slideshow")
          (:script :type "text/javascript"
                   (str (ps* `(progn
                                (var *slideshow-name* ,slideshow-name)
                                (var *images* (array ,@images))
                                (var *current-image-index* ,current-image-index)))))
          (:script :type "text/javascript" :src "/slideshow.js"))
         (:body
          (:div :id "slideshow-container"
                :style "width:100%;text-align:center"
                (:img :id "slideshow-img-object"
                      :src (slideshow-image-uri slideshow-name
                                                (elt images current-image-index)))
                :br
                (:a :href (format nil "/slideshows/~a?image=~a"
                                  slideshow-name (elt images previous-image-index))
                    :onclick (ps (previous-image) (return false))
                    "Previous")
                " "
                (:a :href (format nil "/slideshows/~a?image=~a"
                                  slideshow-name (elt images next-image-index))
                    :onclick (ps (next-image) (return false))
                    "Next"))))))))
    </pre></code>

    <p>
      Since this function is a custom handler, we need to create a new
      dispatcher for it. Note that we're passing the symbol naming the
      handler instead of the function object (which we'd do with the
      <code>#'</code> reader macro), which lets us redefine the handler
      without touching the dispatcher.
    </p>

    <code><pre>
(push (create-prefix-dispatcher "/slideshows/" 'slideshow-handler) 
      *dispatch-table*)
    </pre></code>

    <p>
      The slideshow page can accomodate regular HTML clients; now it is
      time to add dynamic image loading using JavaScript. We can
      accomplish bookmarkability by using the URI fragment identifier
      (however, this will make the browser forward and back buttons
      behave in a counterintuitive way; the fix for this is hacky and
      browser-specific and described here:
      <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Unique_URLs">http://ajaxpatterns.org/Unique_URLs</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Two things to note about the following code are the <code>@</code>
      slot-value chaining convenience macro, and the method calling
      convention. <code>(@ object slotA slotB)</code> expands to
      <code>(slot-value (slot-value object 'slotA) 'slotB)</code>. Parenscript
      function-calling convention is like that of Scheme - the
      <code>car</code> of a form can be any expression that evaluates to
      a function, so we use regular slot access to get at methods.
    </p>

    <code><pre>
(define-easy-handler (js-slideshow :uri "/slideshow.js") ()
  (setf (content-type*) "text/javascript")
  (ps
    (define-symbol-macro fragment-identifier (@ window location hash))
    
    (defun show-image-number (image-index)
      (let ((image-name (aref *images* (setf *current-image-index* image-index))))
        (setf (@ ((@ document get-element-by-id) "slideshow-img-object") src)
              (slideshow-image-uri *slideshow-name* image-name)
              fragment-identifier
              image-name)))
    
    (defun previous-image ()
      (when (> *current-image-index* 0)
        (show-image-number (1- *current-image-index*))))
      
    (defun next-image ()
      (when (< *current-image-index* (1- (@ *images* length)))
        (show-image-number (1+ *current-image-index*))))

    ;; this gives bookmarkability using fragment identifiers
    (setf (@ window onload)
          (lambda ()
            (when fragment-identifier
              (let ((image-name ((@ fragment-identifier slice) 1)))
                (dotimes (i (length *images*))
                  (when (=== image-name (aref *images* i))
                    (return (show-image-number i))))))))))
    </pre></code>
  </body>
