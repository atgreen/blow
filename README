blow is easy to use...

$ blow myapp
[output redacted]
$ cd myapp
$ ./bin/start

Then point your browser at http://localhost:9999.


Here's how it works...

$ blow myapp

The blow command creates a new directory called myapp and fills it
with a template of a Lisp web application as well as supporting
libraries and scripts.  It also initializes the whole lot as a git
repository, so your changes are easily tracked and recorded.  

Look under the myapp/app directory for your web app source.  The 
current template looks something like this:

-rw-r--r-- 1 green green 1570 2009-12-14 18:01 ChangeLog
-rw-r--r-- 1 green green 1951 2009-12-12 00:27 index.blo
-rw-r--r-- 1 green green   33 2009-12-12 00:27 index.jsp
-rw-r--r-- 1 green green  659 2009-12-12 00:27 Makefile
-rw-r--r-- 1 green green  117 2009-12-12 00:27 style.css
drwxr-xr-x 5 green green 4096 2009-12-12 00:32 WEB-INF

Most of the good stuff is under WEB-INF/lisp.


$ cd myapp
$ ./bin/start

blow ships with a small servlet container suitable for testing your
web application.  You run with the bin/start command.  Once you are
happy with your app, simply generate a .war file from the myapp/app
contents and deploy it within your production servlet container.

Have fun!
